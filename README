== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

I would be extremely happy to accept contributions to this project!  If you think something should work differently, send me a message and I'd love to discuss your ideas.  Even better:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add specs for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request.
